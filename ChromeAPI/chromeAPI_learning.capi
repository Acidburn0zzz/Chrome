used to divide everything for now



Create your first app

The manifest tells Chrome about your app, what it is, how to launch it and the extra permissions that it requires.


The background script is used to create the event page responsible for managing the app life cycle.
All code must be included in the Chrome App package. This includes HTML, JS, CSS and Native Client modules.
All icons and other assets must be included in the package as well.


    folder: helloWorldApp

just load unpacked and use it
here you have access to the filesystem, now you need it to communicate with the ultraObject which may come as an extension, but first lets access the desried folder

what chrome apps really look like

you have the app container a GUI
the programming model represents interaction, without the reoruces of a network connection or a browser

it goes like this
    installation, user chooses to explicitly install the app
    startup - how thhe window is lanucned, here you controll communication between other apps
    termination- user can terminiate data anytime, stashing data protects against data laoss
    update - at any time but do not change runtime application in realtime
    uninistalled - no executed code or private data is left behind
    


Security Model
    they want the programmer to code in a secure manner
    they use process isolation, every resource needed for a provess to do is job is given an isolated one
    you can use the object tag to embed extenal content

Chrome App Lifecycle


this controls how the app acts

when the event hs no executing js, window, or callbacks the runtime unloads the event page and closes the app


    Create event page and windows
        every app needs one

ex:
 
"background": {
  "scripts": [
    "foo.js",
    "background.js"
  ]
}


background.js
chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener(function() {
  // Tell your app what to launch and how.
});



Create windows#

    the event  page can mmake one or more windows

chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener(function() {
    chrome.app.window.create('main.html', {
        id: 'MyWindowID',
        bounds: {
            width: 800,
            height: 600,
            left: 100,
            top: 100
        },
        minWidth: 800,
        minHeight: 600
    });
});

sometimes you need to handle launch dates



Listening for app runtime event

    you dont need to set this up but its important you use it
    
        Storing local settings#
        chrome.runtime.onInstalled() is called when your app has first been installed, or when it has been updated

        chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function() {
          chrome.storage.local.set(object items, function callback);
        });

        
        Preventing data loss#
        try to save important data


        Clean-up before app closes
        save it periodically since you can lose its state



Content Security Policy

    What is the CSP for Chrome Apps?

    You can’t use inline scripting in your Chrome App pages. The restriction bans both <script> blocks and event handlers (<button onclick="...">).
    You can’t reference any external resources in any of your app files (except for video and audio resources). You can’t embed external resources in an iframe.
    You can’t use string-to-JavaScript methods like eval() and new Function().
    


    How to comply with CSP
    all js resources should be local

        use precomplied libraries, if not precompiled you have work to do, sandbox cannot interact with chrome API
        to

        You can fetch remote resources via XMLHttpRequest and serve them via blob:, data:, or filesystem: URLs (see Referencing external resources).
        https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_external#external
        chrome trust media externals because the securiy there is very good

        you can use a webframe instead of an embed tag
